                The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in the memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal, after her death in 1631 in Burhanpur, Madhya Pradesh (MP) — which he had initially considered as a site for the mausoleum.
                While it was eventually erected in Agra, in 2021 a Burhanpur man built a stunning marble replica of the Taj Mahal for his own wife. Four years later, the couple has finally revealed what’s inside.
               “This Taj Mahal is our 4BHK home, in which we live, and it’s made from Makrana marble,” said owner Anand Prakash Chouksey while giving a tour. “The original dimensions of the Taj Mahal have been scaled down from metres to feet.”
