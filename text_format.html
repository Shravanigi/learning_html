     <p>In <mark>1894</mark>, English author Rudyard Kipling wrote and published The Jungle Book. It became an instant hit, and Mowgli - its central character
        - soon became a household name. Set in a jungle teeming with life, the book explored the complex relationship between humans and nature.
Over the years, Kipling's story was adapted by several production houses, most notably <b>disney</b>, turning it into a beloved <i>tale of harmony</i> between humans and animals. These adaptations became bedtime staples for many of us growing up. But did you know that The Jungle Book was primarily inspired by a real forest in India? Yes, you read that right.</p>
